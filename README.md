The company expects the website to:

The website consists of one single page, containing 4 separate sections:
* A header

* A "register" section

The header section has a very basic layout. It contains a 'hero' section with a short sentence that defines what the service is about.

The "features" are small snippets of information about what the service offers.

The "testimonials" provide quotes of individuals from different walks of life, meant to not only inform the user about the benefits of the service, but also allow the user to understand that the service is targetted to various groups of people: students, single people with busy careers, couples, etc.

The "register" section allows the user to easily register with the service. At the bottom, there's a footer providing links to social media platforms, in case the user is interested in more information.
